In this project, we aim to:

Develop a predictive model to accurately forecast sales and demand for Walmart, considering the impact of promotional markdown events and high-traffic holiday periods.
Analyze the influence of economic conditions, specifically the Consumer Price Index and Unemployment Index, on sales.
Ultimately, our goal is to provide actionable insights to enhance Walmartâ€™s business operations and its customer experience.
